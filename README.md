# Simplest Ollama interface

This repository contains a simple Python script that makes it easy to interact with [Ollama's Llama3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3) and save the chats. There are no fancy front-ends here. Just a straightforward way to communicate with the LLM and have the markdown responses rendered using, for example, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
